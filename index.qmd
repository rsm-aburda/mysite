Currently I'm a Data Analyst at GIA 💎 in a product-focused role, partnering with leadership to turn data into decisions, experiments, and roadmap direction.

Outside of work, I build and operate Upcycled Supply Co, a sustainable outdoor gear brand where I’ve taken products from concept to market. That includes product development, manufacturer coordination, go-to-market strategy, and running direct-to-consumer operations end to end.

I recently completed my Master’s in Business Analytics, strengthening my foundation in experimentation, decision science, and consumer behavior.
