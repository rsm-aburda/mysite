        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n",
        "\n",
        "The original experiment was conducted in partnership with a nonprofit that supported economically disadvantaged children. The researchers sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each recipient to one of three treatment groups:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Standard Letter (Control):** A basic appeal describing the mission of the organization and requesting support.\n",
        "- **Matching Grant Treatment:** A letter stating that donations would be matched dollar-for-dollar by a lead donor, up to a specific amount.\n",
        "- **Challenge Grant Treatment:** A letter explaining that a lead donor had pledged a large donation, but only if a threshold level of additional contributions was met.\n",
        "\n",
        "The treatments were randomized to ensure internal validity, and the primary outcomes measured were:\n",
        "- A binary indicator of whether a donation was made\n",
        "- The dollar amount donated\n",
        "\n",
        "By comparing outcomes across the three groups, Karlan and List aimed to uncover how different types of financial incentives (matching vs. challenge grants) influence donation behavior. The results showed that **matching grants significantly increased both the likelihood of donating and the average donation amount**, while challenge grants had a weaker and more ambiguous impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment has since become a cornerstone in the field of behavioral economics and charitable giving, demonstrating how small shifts in message framing can meaningfully alter real-world behavior.\n",
